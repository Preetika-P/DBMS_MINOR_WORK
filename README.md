# DBMS_MINOR_WORK

### Task A1

In this task, I worked on a project that shows basic file operations using C. This includes:
- Creating a file.
- Writing data to the file.
- Reading data from the file.
- Handling errors using system calls like `open`, `read`, `write`, `lseek`, and `close`.

### Task A2

In this task, I focused on indexing and its related operations, which include:
- Modifying a value.
- Inserting a new value.
- Deleting a value.
- Finding a value through an index.

### Task A3

For this task, I wrote a Java program that reads data from an Excel file using the Apache POI library. This library is commonly used for manipulating Microsoft Office files like Excel workbooks. The program demonstrates how to read an Excel file (.xlsx) and print its contents to the console.
